### Upgrade warnings

* The DNS conflict timeout setting (found under Provisioning) has been changed from an integer to an array of values (separated by comma). It's also renamed to `DNS timeout`. It used to represent timeout (in seconds) for DNS lookup attempts such as the dns_lookup macro and DNS record conflict validations. Multiple values in the array now represent multiple attempts to resolve name over DNS with the default value of [5, 10, 15, 20]. If this value was modified however, the upgrade process will keep the single value. This means there's no retry. Users who've changed this value should review the new value.
* Foreman no longer imports all facts, structured facts (e.g. `networking::interface`) and selected root facts (identified by hardcoded list - see below) are imported up to 100 elements. If a host reports more, they will be dropped and fact named `foreman::dropped_subtree_facts` will contain approximate number of facts dropped (e.g. `2 thousands`). The maximum amount of facts is configurable via Administer - Settings - Provisioning. This change was implemented for large deployments with many nodes and/or hypervisors or container hosts with many virtual network cards, bridges, mountpoints or volumes. The list of root nodes filtered out:
  * blockdevice_
  * ipaddress6?_
  * macaddress_
  * mtu_
  * speed_
  * auto_negotiation_
  * duplex_
  * link_
  * wol_
* Updating a nested resource in the API with a non existing id will no longer fail with the response status code `404 Not Found`, But it will instead fail with `422 Unprocessable Entity` and will present a correct error message. [#26754](https://projects.theforeman.org/issues/26754)
* Multiple methods and tasks that have been deprecated over the past few releases have been removed. Especially noteworthy: 
  * Operating sytems methods `repos` and `medium_uri` have been removed. `pxe_files` method now accepts only one parameter, a medium provider.
  * Template macro `snippets` has been removed in favor of `snippet` macro. The `@repos` template variable has also been removed.
  * Rake tasks `puppet:import:puppet_classes` and `puppet:import:environments_only` have been removed. These actions should be done by using the matching UI or API actions.
  * The `foreman-config` script has been removed. Use `foreman-rake config` instead.
