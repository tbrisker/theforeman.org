### Upgrade warnings

* MySQL database is no longer supported. Users should migrate their data to PostgreSQL *Prior* to upgrading to 2.0. [Further details](https://theforeman.org/2019/09/dropping-support-for-mysql.html)
* SQLite is officially not supported for production deployments any longer. While it shouldn't have been used as a production database and only be used for development, with this release we are officially declaring it unsupported in production. SQLite storage of boolean variables [has changed](https://projects.theforeman.org/issues/24838) due to changes in Ruby on Rails and data can not be easily migrated. Any developers using it can try running [this script](https://github.com/theforeman/foreman/pull/7171#issuecomment-552490998) to convert most of their database prior to performing the upgrade to 2.0. Additional manual actions may be needed to ensure all data is properly migrated. [Further details](https://community.theforeman.org/t/dropping-support-for-sqlite-as-production-database/16158/)
* Ubuntu Xenial (16.04) is no longer supported. Users should upgrade to Bionic (18.04) prior to upgrading Foreman to this release.
* Debian Stretch (9) is no longer supported. Users should upgrade to Buster (10) prior to upgrading Foreman to this release.
* Smart Variables have been removed. Users should use Smart Class Parameters or Global Parameters instead. [Further details](https://community.theforeman.org/t/dropping-smart-variables/16176)
