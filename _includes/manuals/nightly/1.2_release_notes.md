### Upgrade warnings

* MySQL database is no longer supported. Users should migrate their data to PostgreSQL *Prior* to upgrading to 2.0. [Further details](https://theforeman.org/2019/09/dropping-support-for-mysql.html)
* SQLite is officially not supported for production deployments any longer. While it shouldn't have been used as a production database and only be used for development, with this release we are officially declaring it unsupported in production. SQLite storage of boolean variables [has changed](https://projects.theforeman.org/issues/24838) due to changes in Ruby on Rails and data can not be easily migrated. Any developers using it can try running [this script](https://github.com/theforeman/foreman/pull/7171#issuecomment-552490998) to convert most of their database prior to performing the upgrade to 2.0. Additional manual actions may be needed to ensure all data is properly migrated. [Further details](https://community.theforeman.org/t/dropping-support-for-sqlite-as-production-database/16158/)
* Ubuntu Xenial (16.04) is no longer supported. Users should upgrade to Bionic (18.04) prior to upgrading Foreman to this release.
* Debian Stretch (9) is no longer supported. Users should upgrade to Buster (10) prior to upgrading Foreman to this release.
* Smart Variables have been removed. Users should use Smart Class Parameters or Global Parameters instead. [Further details](https://community.theforeman.org/t/dropping-smart-variables/16176)
* API endpoints and parameters refering to `config_template[s]` have been removed. Config Templates was the previous name for Provisioning Templates, which were renamed nearly 5 years ago. These long-deprecated endpoints and parameters have been removed and should be replaced by `provisioning_template[s]` respectively in any automation still using them. [Further details](https://projects.theforeman.org/issues/28582)
* The API parameter `use_puppet_default` for smart class parameters and overrides has been dropped. This parameter has been renamed to `omit` and deprecated in Foreman 1.14 and kept for compatibility until this release. [Further details](https://projects.theforeman.org/issues/28583)
* The `api/hosts/<id>/status` endpoint has been removed. Hosts have multiple statuses, to get the configuration status that was provided by this end point use the more specific `api/hosts/<id>/status/configuration` endpoint. [Further details](https://projects.theforeman.org/issues/28585)
* The parameters `name` and `resource_type` have been removed from the permissions API endpoint. The same results can be gained by using the `search` parameter with `name = my_permission_name` or `resource_type = my_resource_type` values. [Further details](https://projects.theforeman.org/issues/28591)
* The `uuid` parameter has been removed from the compute resources API endpoint. The `datacenter` parameter should be used instead. [Further details](https://projects.theforeman.org/issues/28592)
* The host create and update API no longer accepts the `nested` attribute for the `host_parameters_attributes` parameter. This attribute has been ignored and deprecated since Foreman 1.10. [Further details]((https://projects.theforeman.org/issues/28593)
* The `api/reports` endpoint has been renamed to `api/config_reports` in Foreman 1.11 and is now removed. The exception is the POST action for new report creation that is kept for backwards compatibility. [Further details]((https://projects.theforeman.org/issues/28594)
