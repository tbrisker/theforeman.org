* The settings `:login`, `:locations_enabled` and `:organizations_enabled` have been removed. Login, locations and organizations will now always be enabled. Users that previously had locations and/or organizations disabled will have a default location/organization created during `db:seed` and all resources will be assigned to it. Users that previously had login disabled will now need to log in to the system, the admin user's password can be reset using `foreman-rake permissions:reset`. For more information please see [the RFC](https://community.theforeman.org/t/proposal-remove-support-for-disabling-taxonomies-or-login/10972).
