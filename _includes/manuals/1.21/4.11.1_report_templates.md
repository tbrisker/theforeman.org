You can find existing report templates under Monitor -> Report Templates. Foreman
comes with few default report templates that are locked. As with other templates,
we do not recommend unlocking and modifying them, as they are automatically updated
on upgrades. If a change of default template is desired, it's recommended to clone
the template and do adjustments in the clone.

To generate a report out of the report template, find the report template and click
the *Generate* button. This will evaluate a template and respond with text file
for download. Note that the rendering is done by the web server process and can
consume a lot of resources if it generates a lot of data.

There's a separate permission for generating the report, so only selected users
can perform resource heavy operations while another users can prepare the report
templates.
