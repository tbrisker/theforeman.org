## Release notes for {{page.version}}

### Headline features
#### Organizations, Locations and Login are always enabled
Following the [discussion](https://community.theforeman.org/t/proposal-remove-support-for-disabling-taxonomies-or-login/10972) on the community forums, the settings allowing disabling of organizations, locations and login have been removed. This change will allow simplifying the code base and providing a better and more stable experience to all users. See the upgrade warnings section below and the discussion on discourse for further information.

#### New Diff viewer
A new and improved diff viewer has been added to config reports and audits. Work is ongoing to incorporate it into other places as well, eventually replacing the existing diff viewer completely. ([#19067](https://projects.theforeman.org/issues/19067), [#25439](https://projects.theforeman.org/issues/25439))

#### Huawei VRP support
Support has been added for provisioning Huawei switches running VRP. ([#24728](https://projects.theforeman.org/issues/24728), [#25432](https://projects.theforeman.org/issues/25432))

#### Performance and stabilization
This release includes many bug fixes and performance improvements. Some highlights include the multiple improvements in reporting template generation, better logging, faster smart class parameter and host edit pages, fixes to provisioning templates and much more.

### Deprecations

* In order to improve logging experience, the following Rails middleware was
moved to separate files and under Foreman Ruby namespace:
Middleware::LoggingContext, Middleware::CatchJsonParseErrors,
Middleware::Telemetry. Plugins using `config.middleware.insert_before` or
`config.middleware.insert_after` must update the statements accordingly
([#25619](https://projects.theforeman.org/issues/25619)).
* Several methods related to taxonomies have been deprecated and will be removed in 1.23: `Taxonomy.locations_enabled`, `Taxonomy.organizations_unabled`, `Taxonomy.enabled?`, `Taxonomy.enabled_taxonomies`, `Setting.default_organization`, `Setting.default_location`, `Setting.organization_fact`, `Setting.location_fact`. Any plugins using them should be updated accordingly ([#25702](https://projects.theforeman.org/issues/25702)).
* Passing a class to `add_controller_action_scope` in plugin initialization has been deprecated, please pass class name as a string instead ([#25717](https://projects.theforeman.org/issues/25717)).

### Upgrade warnings

* The settings `:login`, `:locations_enabled` and `:organizations_enabled` have been removed. Login, locations and organizations will now always be enabled. Users that previously had locations and/or organizations disabled will have a default location/organization created during `db:seed` and all resources will be assigned to it. Users that previously had login disabled will now need to log in to the system, the admin user's password can be reset using `foreman-rake permissions:reset`. For more information please see [the RFC](https://community.theforeman.org/t/proposal-remove-support-for-disabling-taxonomies-or-login/10972).
* Puppet 6 is not yet fully supported by Foreman. The smart proxy is not yet able to manage Puppet 6's CA, and the installer may generate some warnings when running. Full support is expected in Foreman 1.22.
