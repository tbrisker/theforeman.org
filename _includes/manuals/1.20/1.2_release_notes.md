## Release notes for {{page.version}}

This section will be updated prior to the next release.

### Headline features
#### UI Improvements

Multiple changes have been made in the graphical user interface, thanks to the
capabilities provided by the new react-based stack. These include a new design
for the Audits page, improved search bar and pagination, better navigation, and
many others fixes and improvements.

#### Report templates

A new mechanism has been added that allows generating custom reports.
See the [Reports](manuals/{{page.version}}/index.html#4.11Reports) section
for more information.

#### Template rendering engine rewrite

The engine used to render templates has been refactored to allow better
extendability and testing. Please report any issues found when rendering
templates after the upgrade.

#### Rails 5.2 upgrade

Foreman has been updated to run on the latest version of Ruby on Rails at the
time of the release, 5.2.1. Many plugins have already been updated as well, but
there may be issues with any that have not seen a new release in a while.

#### New system admin role

The purpose of this role is to set up environment for others to use. It can
create organizations/locations but does not have access to the resources inside
them. System admin can create new users and assign them to locations or
organizations and add roles to the users.  See
[Roles and Permissions](manuals/{{page.version}}/index.html#4.1.2RolesandPermissions)
for more information.

#### FIPS compliance

Foreman can now run properly in FIPS-enabled environments.

### Deprecations

* The ability to disable login, organizations or locations via settings has been deprecated and will be
removed in version 1.21. Please enable these settings in your `settings.yaml` file.
* The `snippets` template macro has been deprecated and will be removed in 1.22, please use `snippet` instead.
* The `modulepath` setting had no effect and has been removed.
* Operating System `repos` method has been deprecated in favor of MediumProviders `additional_media` method and will be removed in 1.22. Please update any templates using this method to use the new method instead.
* Operating System `medium_uri` method has been deprecated in favor of MediumProviders `medium_uri` method and will be removed in 1.22. Please update any templates using this method to use the new method instead.
* The Operating System API endpoint for `bootfiles` has also been deprecated and will be removed in 1.22. Bootfiles should be calculated per host.

### Upgrade warnings

* A migration checking for duplicate puppet classes was added. If you see `Please make sure there are no
duplicate Puppet classes before continuing.` during upgrade process, your database contains multiple puppet
classes with the same name. This can happen on environments with many parallel operations happening at the
same time. In order to prevent this in future, we decided to add a constraint on database level. That also
means that existing duplicates need to be unified manually. Either delete all duplicates from `puppetclasses`
table or try using [foreman-maintain](https://github.com/theforeman/foreman_maintain) that should fix the issue.
For more information, see [the redmine issue](http://projects.theforeman.org/issues/24923/)
* A change introduced to the host fact API in 1.19.0 has led to incompatibilities and has been reverted.
Any scripts using this API may need to be updated accordingly.
See ([the redmine issue](https://projects.theforeman.org/issues/25188)) for more details.
* The ability to define `puppetconfdir`, `puppetvardir` and `puppetssldir` via `settings.yaml` has
been removed. The `ssl_certificate`, `ssl_ca_file` and `ssl_priv_key` options, which defaulted to using these
values as part of their default, should now be configured via the UI, CLI or API, or a default value for
them can be set directly in `settings.yaml` or via the installer.
* Access to `@host.params['param_name']` in templates, which has been deprecated several versions ago, has been removed. Templates can access host parameters using the `host_param('param_name')` macro instead.
* Operating System `pxe_files`, `pxe_prefix`, `kernel`, `initrd`, `bootfile`, `boot_files_uri`  methods now expect a Medium Provider as their first argument. Please update any templates accordingly. See the [redmine issue](https://projects.theforeman.org/issues/19389) and [associated changes](https://github.com/theforeman/foreman/commit/ef1bbc264acfe0864bd24e7ce54e6b37dcda37ad) for further details.
* The audit history doesn't display correctly if locations or organizations have been disabled in your settings.yaml. These options are now deprecated, see [the redmine issue](https://projects.theforeman.org/issues/24800) for more details.
* For installations with MySQL as a backend it must be version 5.7 to support index prefixes larger than 767 bytes. Older versions result in the db migration "Add type to token" failing and leaving the system unusable. Failed upgrades can be recovered by upgrading mysql to 5.7 then re-running the migration scripts.
