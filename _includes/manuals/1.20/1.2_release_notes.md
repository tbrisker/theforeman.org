## Release notes for {{page.version}}

This section will be updated prior to the next release.

### Headline features

#### UI Improvements

Multiple changes have been made in the graphical user interface, thanks to the
capabilities provided by the new react-based stack. These include a new design
for the Audits page, improved search bar and pagination, better navigation, and
many others fixes and improvements.

#### Report templates

A new mechanism has been added that allows generating custom reports.
See the [Reports](manuals/{{page.version}}/index.html#4.11Reports) section
for more information.

#### Template rendering engine rewrite

The engine used to render templates has been refactored to allow better
extendability and testing. Please report any issues found when rendering
templates after the upgrade.

#### Rails 5.2 upgrade

Foreman has been updated to run on the latest version of Ruby on Rails at the
time of the release, 5.2.1. Many plugins have already been updated as well, but
there may be issues with any that have not seen a new release in a while.

#### New system admin role

The purpose of this role is to set up environment for others to use. It can
create organizations/locations but does not have access to the resources inside
them. System admin can create new users and assign them to locations or
organizations and add roles to the users.  See
[Roles and Permissions](manuals/{{page.version}}/index.html#4.1.2RolesandPermissions)
for more information.

#### FIPS compliance

Foreman should now run properly in FIPS-enabled environments.

### Deprecations

* The `snippets` template macro has been deprecated and will be removed in 1.22, please use `snippet` instead.

### Upgrade warnings

* A migration checking for duplicate puppet classes was added. If you see `Please make sure there are no
duplicate Puppet classes before continuing.` during upgrade process, your database contains multiple puppet
classes with the same name. This can happen on environments with many parallel operations happening at the
same time. In order to prevent this in future, we decided to add a constraint on database level. That also
means that existing duplicates need to be unified manually. Either delete all duplicates from `puppetclasses`
table or try using [foreman-maintain](https://github.com/theforeman/foreman_maintain) that should fix the issue.
For more information, see [the redmine issue](http://projects.theforeman.org/issues/24923/)
