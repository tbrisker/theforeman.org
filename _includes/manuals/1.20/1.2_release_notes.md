### Features

### Bug Fixes

### Deprecations

* The `snippets` template macro has been deprecated and will be removed in 1.22, please use `snippet` instead.

### Upgrade warnings

* A migration checking for duplicate puppet classes was added. If you see `Please make sure there are no
duplicate Puppet classes before continuing.` during upgrade process, your database contains multiple puppet
classes with the same name. This can happen on environments with many parallel operations happening at the
same time. In order to prevent this in future, we decided to add a constraint on database level. That also
means that existing duplicates need to be unified manually. Either delete all duplicates from `puppetclasses`
table or try using [foreman-maintain](https://github.com/theforeman/foreman_maintain) that should fix the issue.
For more information, see [the redmine issue](http://projects.theforeman.org/issues/24923/)
